                  <p style="color: black;"> One day there was a sign of the birth of a new Iser god in Asgard,
                     and there was a powerful sound of lightning and torrents
                      <input type="button" value="PLAY" onclick="play()" class="Lightning">
                      <audio id="audio" src="Lightning.mp4"></audio>
                      that surrounded all parts of Asgard. He was the god of thunder thor,
                      unlike his father, Odin the king of Asgard, Thor was a quick-tempered,
                       ruthless and unintelligent , Thor's mother was from the giants' clan,
                        yet he inherited a thor from his father his hatred for the race of giants,
                         so he was called the killer of giants and protector of Asgard , Thor was one of the most powerful gods of Iser
                         , even surpassing his father in terms of strength, but he did not inherit the wisdom of Odin
                         , as he was always being deceived and was distinguished by the color of his dark red hair as the color of blood
                         Thor possesses many magic tools,
                          thor could not fly so he had a magic chariot drawn by two goats to move across worlds ,
                          One of the most important magical tools that Thor uses is his mjolner,
                           which was made by the brothers Brooke and Cindy, using the strongest metals and great fires to forge them.
